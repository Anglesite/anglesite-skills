# Architectural Decision Records

These are the default technical choices the Webmaster agent follows when building your website. They're starting points, not rules — every decision here can be revisited if it doesn't serve your goals.

**You own these decisions.** If you want to switch from system fonts to a custom typeface, add Google Analytics, use a different hosting provider, or change anything else — tell your Webmaster and update the relevant ADR. Superseded decisions stay in the record (marked `superseded by ADR-NNNN`) so there's a clear trail of what changed and why.

To change a decision: tell your Webmaster what you want to do differently. They'll update the ADR, adjust the site, and keep everything in sync.

ADRs follow the [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format.
