Run a full health check on the site — and fix what you find. If the owner described a specific problem, diagnose that first; otherwise run the full audit below. The checklists are for you (the agent) — **do not show raw checklist items, technical terms, or jargon to the owner.** Translate every finding into plain English. See the Results section at the bottom for how to present findings.

## Architecture decisions

These explain *why* each check category matters:

- [ADR-0004 Vanilla CSS](references/docs/decisions/0004-vanilla-css-custom-properties.md) — contrast verification against CSS custom properties
- [ADR-0005 System fonts](references/docs/decisions/0005-system-fonts.md) — flag external font CDN links as violations
- [ADR-0006 IndieWeb POSSE](references/docs/decisions/0006-indieweb-posse.md) — why h-card, h-entry, h-feed, and `rel="me"` are checked
- [ADR-0007 Pre-deploy scans](references/docs/decisions/0007-mandatory-pre-deploy-scans.md) — why PII, token, and script scans are mandatory
- [ADR-0008 No third-party JS](references/docs/decisions/0008-no-third-party-javascript.md) — why third-party scripts are flagged
- [ADR-0012 Verify first](references/docs/decisions/0012-verify-before-presenting.md) — build baseline before checking other categories
- [ADR-0016 Accessibility audits](references/docs/decisions/0016-accessibility-audits.md) — why the WCAG audit runs automatically and how the severity-aware exit codes work
- [ADR-0017 Agent readability audits](references/docs/decisions/0017-agent-readability-audits.md) — why a14y always runs informationally here, even when `AGENTIC_CRAWLERS=block`

Read `EXPLAIN_STEPS` from `.site-config`. If `true` or not set, explain before every tool call that will trigger a permission prompt — tell the owner what you're about to do and why in plain English. If `false`, proceed without pre-announcing tool calls.

## Build checks
- [ ] `npx astro check` passes (TypeScript)
- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds
- [ ] All pages have title, meta description, OG tags
- [ ] Images have alt text and are reasonably sized (<500KB)

## Accessibility (WCAG AA)

These checks are not optional. Accessibility failures are as serious as security failures.

### Automated audit

Build the site first, then run the unified accessibility audit:

```sh
npm run ai-a11y
```

The report is written to `reports/a11y-report.md` (the `reports/` directory is gitignored — regenerated on demand, never committed).

This script (`scripts/a11y-audit.ts`) walks every HTML file in `dist/` and produces a per-page WCAG 2.1 AA report with suggested fixes. It runs three checkers and aggregates the results:

1. **Heuristic checks** (always on, no install) — heading hierarchy, link text quality, alt text quality (via `scripts/a11y-validate.ts`).
2. **pa11y / pa11y-ci** — full WCAG 2.1 AA scan when installed (`npm install -D pa11y` or `pa11y-ci`). Catches contrast, ARIA, label association, and landmark issues the heuristic pass can't see.
3. **axe-core via Playwright** — modern rule engine when installed (`npm install -D @axe-core/playwright playwright`). Provides rich selector/remediation context.

Any tool that isn't installed is skipped automatically — the audit always runs at least the heuristic pass.

### Severity-aware exit codes (CI use)

The script exits with:

- `0` — no errors and no warnings (or `--warn-only` was passed)
- `1` — one or more WCAG 2.1 AA violations
- `2` — warnings only (best-practice issues, no AA violation)

Pass `--warn-only` (or set `A11Y_WARN_ONLY=true` in `.site-config`) to always exit `0` while a site is mid-remediation. Pass `--json` for a machine-readable report.

### Programmatic validation

Use the accessibility utilities in `scripts/` for additional checks beyond the audit script:

- **Color contrast** — `scripts/contrast.ts`: read CSS custom properties from `src/styles/global.css` and verify `meetsWcagAA(textColor, bgColor)` for all text/background pairs
- **Content quality** — `scripts/a11y-validate.ts`: run `validateHeadingHierarchy()`, `validateLinkText()`, and `validateImageAlt()` against the built HTML output (the audit script already calls these)

### Manual checks (inspect the built HTML)
- [ ] Every page has exactly one `<h1>`, and headings don't skip levels
- [ ] Color contrast meets 4.5:1 for body text and 3:1 for large text — verify the CSS custom properties in `src/styles/global.css`
- [ ] All interactive elements (links, buttons, form inputs) are keyboard-reachable
- [ ] No images of text (use real text instead)
- [ ] Skip-to-content link present in the layout
- [ ] Form inputs have associated `<label>` elements
- [ ] `lang` attribute set on `<html>` element
- [ ] `/accessibility` statement page exists and is linked from the footer

If any accessibility check fails, explain what the issue is, who it affects, and how to fix it.

## Agent readability (a14y)

Anglesite sites are built and maintained by AI agents — they should also be *readable* by other agents (search agents, browsing agents, content-mapping agents). [a14y.dev](https://a14y.dev) is an open scoring service (Apache-2.0) that runs 38 checks across discoverability, parsing, and comprehension and emits a numeric score plus a per-check pass/fail report.

The audit needs a running HTTP server. Make sure the dev server is up at `https://DEV_HOSTNAME` (or pass an explicit URL with `--url`) before running:

```sh
npm run ai-a14y
```

Optional flags (forwarded to the a14y CLI):

- `--url https://...` — audit a specific URL instead of `https://DEV_HOSTNAME`
- `--fail-under 80` — set the score threshold for CI use
- `--json` — machine-readable output (a14y emits a versioned scorecard JSON)
- `--warn-only` — never fail the process, even when the score is below the threshold

Or set the equivalent `.site-config` keys: `A14Y_FAIL_UNDER` and `A14Y_WARN_ONLY=true`.

If a14y isn't installed, the script prints install instructions and exits with code `127`. To install:

```sh
npm install --save-dev a14y
```

When the audit returns findings, translate them for the owner: a14y rule IDs (e.g. `llms-txt-missing`, `structured-data-thin`) are technical labels — describe the *user-visible impact* ("AI agents that try to summarize your site won't have a quick reference") and the concrete fix.

### Relationship to the deploy gate

`AGENTIC_CRAWLERS` in `.site-config` controls whether a14y also gates `/anglesite:deploy`:

- **`AGENTIC_CRAWLERS=allow`** (default when unset) — a14y is a deploy gate; below-threshold scores pause publishing.
- **`AGENTIC_CRAWLERS=block`** — the owner has declared agentic crawlers shouldn't read this site. The check still runs here for reference, but **never blocks deploy** — gating on agent-readability when the policy is to keep agents out would be incoherent.

If the owner is unsure, the default (`allow`) reflects Anglesite's open-by-default stance.

## Mobile and responsive

Check that the site works on small screens. Start the dev server if not already running.

- [ ] Viewport meta tag present: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling at 320px width — check for fixed-width elements, overflow, or images without `max-width: 100%`
- [ ] Text is readable without zooming (minimum 16px body text)
- [ ] Touch targets are at least 44x44px (links, buttons)
- [ ] Navigation is usable on small screens (hamburger menu, collapsible nav, or simple enough to not need one)
- [ ] Images use responsive sizing (`max-width: 100%` or `srcset`)
- [ ] No content hidden on mobile that's visible on desktop (all information should be available)

## Cloudflare account alignment

Read `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` from `.site-config`. If set, call `mcp__cloudflare__accounts_list` and check which account is currently active.

- If the active account matches the configured one, mark this category as **All good**.
- If they differ, flag it as **Worth fixing soon** with plain-language framing: "Your computer is currently signed into a different Cloudflare account than the one this site lives in. The next deploy would refuse to publish until you switch back. I can switch the active account for you, or you can run `/anglesite:deploy` and let it sort itself out."
- If `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is unset (older sites set up before this check), suggest running `/anglesite:deploy` once so the picker can lock the site to a specific account.

This check is informational — never block the audit on it. Owners often switch accounts intentionally during the workday.

## Deployed worker drift

Local checks confirm the source compiles — they can't see what's actually running on Cloudflare. When an owner reports "the contact form isn't sending email" or "subscribers aren't being added," the most common cause is local edits that were never deployed.

Run this only if `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is set in `.site-config` and the active account matches it (see "Cloudflare account alignment" above). If accounts don't match, skip this section — calling Workers APIs against the wrong account would produce misleading results. If `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is unset, skip silently.

Read `references/skills/check/deployed-worker-drift.md` and follow
the instructions to verify each Cloudflare Worker the site uses against its
deployed counterpart.

## Privacy audit
- [ ] No customer PII in `dist/` (emails, phone numbers, names)
- [ ] No customer PII in git staging area
- [ ] `.env` files not tracked by git
- [ ] No API tokens or secrets in source or built files

## Security audit
- [ ] Security headers intact in `public/_headers` (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- [ ] No third-party scripts except Cloudflare Web Analytics
- [ ] No `/keystatic` routes in production build
- [ ] `robots.txt` blocks `/keystatic/`
- [ ] No `.env` files in `dist/` or `public/`
- [ ] `npm audit` — check for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Images in `public/images/` checked for EXIF GPS data (see `docs/security.md`)

## Link health

Run the automated link checker after a successful build:

```sh
npm run ai-linkcheck
```

This scans every page in `dist/` and reports:
- **Broken internal links** (warn) — hrefs that don't resolve to a file in `dist/`
- **Orphaned pages** (info) — pages with no inbound link from any other page or sitemap

To also check external links (slower — makes HTTP requests), run:

```sh
npm run ai-linkcheck -- --external
```

This additionally reports:
- **Broken external links** (warn) — URLs that return 4xx/5xx or time out
- **Redirect chains > 1 hop** (info) — detected from `public/_redirects`

If any links are intentionally broken or external (e.g., internal-only domains, staging URLs), the owner can add them to `.site-config`:

```
LINK_CHECK_ALLOW=staging.example.com,internal.corp
```

Multiple patterns are comma-separated. Wildcards are supported: `https://cdn.example.com/*`.

IndieWeb endpoint routes (`/auth` and its subpaths, `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, `/micropub`, `/media`, `/webmention`) are recognized automatically when the matching `INDIEWEB_*` flags are set in `.site-config` — they're served by the site Worker, not by files in `dist/`, so the link checker never reports them as broken. No allowlist entry needed.

Present link health findings using the same severity mapping as other checks:
- Broken internal links → **"Worth fixing soon"** with the affected page and target
- Broken external links → **"Worth fixing soon"** (the linked site may be temporarily down — suggest re-checking)
- Orphaned pages → **"All good (heads up)"** — mention the page exists but nothing links to it
- Redirect chains → **"All good (heads up)"** — mention the chain and suggest collapsing it

## Content and SEO
- [ ] Every page has a unique `<title>` and `<meta name="description">`
- [ ] Open Graph tags present (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`)
- [ ] Sitemap exists at `/sitemap-index.xml`
- [ ] `robots.txt` exists and includes sitemap URL
- [ ] Blog posts have valid frontmatter (title, description, publishDate)
- [ ] Business name, address, and contact info are easy to find (not buried)

### Agentic-crawler policy alignment

Read `AGENTIC_CRAWLERS` from `.site-config` (default `allow`) and confirm `llms.txt` and `robots.txt` reflect that single source of truth:

- [ ] Run `auditRobotsTxt(content, siteUrl, agenticCrawlers)` from `scripts/seo.ts` against `dist/robots.txt`. Under `allow`, no centralized agentic crawler should be in a `Disallow: /` block; under `block`, every entry in `AGENTIC_CRAWLER_BOTS` should appear with `Disallow: /`. If anything is off, regenerate `public/robots.txt` via `generateRobotsTxt(...)` and rebuild.
- [ ] If `AGENTIC_CRAWLERS=block`, confirm `dist/llms.txt` does **not** exist (and `public/llms.txt` doesn't either). Publishing an AI-readable index when the owner has blocked agents is incoherent — flag it as "Worth fixing soon" and offer to delete the file.
- [ ] If `AGENTIC_CRAWLERS=allow` and the site has substantial content, mention that `llms.txt` gives AI agents a quick reference and offer to generate one (see `/anglesite:seo` Step 5).

The list of tracked agentic crawler user-agents (`GPTBot`, `ClaudeBot`, `anthropic-ai`, `CCBot`, `Google-Extended`, `PerplexityBot`, `Bytespider`) lives in `AGENTIC_CRAWLER_BOTS` in `template/scripts/seo.ts`. Add new agents there — every surface above reads from that one list.

## Copy quality

If `BUSINESS_TYPE` is set in `.site-config`, invoke the copy-edit skill for content quality coaching.

Read the `copy-edit` skill and follow it. Note that this is a non-interactive check context — present 1-5 findings as a brief section, no questions. Include the output as a "Copy quality" section in the health report. If `BUSINESS_TYPE` is not set, still run the audit using generic best practices.

## Legal compliance

Check that the site has the legal pages appropriate for its features and business type. Read `BUSINESS_TYPE` and `ECOMMERCE_PROVIDER` from `.site-config`. Refer to `references/docs/smb/legal-checklist.md` for the full checklist and `references/docs/smb/legal-templates.md` for free template sources.

- [ ] Privacy policy page exists at `/privacy/` and is linked from the footer
- [ ] Copyright notice in the footer with the current year
- [ ] Accessibility statement exists at `/accessibility/` (or as a section on another page) and is linked from the footer
- [ ] If ecommerce is configured (`ECOMMERCE_PROVIDER` set): terms of service exists at `/terms/`
- [ ] If ecommerce is configured: return/refund policy exists at `/returns/` or `/refund-policy/`
- [ ] If physical goods ecommerce (snipcart, shopify-buy-button): shipping policy exists
- [ ] If `BUSINESS_TYPE` is a licensed profession (legal, healthcare, accounting, insurance, fitness, contractor, real-estate): professional disclaimer present in footer or on a dedicated page
- [ ] If booking is configured: cancellation policy is visible on the booking page
- [ ] Newsletter signup forms include a clear description of what subscribers will receive

Report legal compliance findings as **"Worth fixing soon"** severity, not deploy blockers. Frame findings as helpful next steps:

| Missing item | What to tell the owner |
|---|---|
| No privacy policy | "Your site collects contact info through the form, so it needs a privacy policy page. I can draft one for you — it's straightforward since your site doesn't track visitors." |
| No terms of service (with ecommerce) | "Since you're selling through your website, you'll want a terms of service page. I can create one as a starting point." |
| No return policy (with ecommerce) | "Customers will want to know your return policy before buying. I'll add a page for that." |
| Missing professional disclaimer | "Most [profession] websites include a disclaimer. I'll add a brief one to your footer." |
| Missing copyright notice | "I'll add a copyright line to your footer — it's a small thing that signals ownership." |

## IndieWeb (see `docs/indieweb.md`)
- [ ] `h-card` in site header with `p-name` and `u-url`
- [ ] `h-entry` on blog posts with `p-name`, `dt-published`, `e-content`
- [ ] Blog listing page wrapped in `h-feed`
- [ ] `rel="me"` links present for the owner's social profiles
- [ ] Syndication links render as `u-syndication` with `rel="syndication"`
- [ ] RSS feed at `/rss.xml` with `<link rel="alternate">` discovery in `<head>`
- [ ] Event pages use `h-event` markup if the business hosts events

## Canvas and interactive content accessibility

If the site has `<canvas>` elements (creative effects, experiments, visualizations), verify:

- [ ] Every `<canvas>` has either `aria-label` (if it conveys content) or `aria-hidden="true"` (if purely decorative)
- [ ] Pages with required JavaScript have a `<noscript>` fallback (description + static image for experiment pages)
- [ ] `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected — animations stop or simplify when reduced motion is preferred
- [ ] No content flashes more than 3 times per second (WCAG 2.3.1)
- [ ] Interactive experiments document keyboard controls (if applicable)

These checks apply to any page with `<canvas>`, not just web-artist sites — a bakery with a snow effect needs the same accessibility treatment.

## Performance
- [ ] Images are in modern formats (.webp preferred) and optimized (<500KB)
- [ ] No render-blocking resources in `<head>` beyond essential CSS
- [ ] CSS is reasonably sized (check for unused rules)
- [ ] No large JavaScript bundles in `dist/_astro/` (Astro should produce near-zero client JS)

For a thorough performance audit, tell the owner: "Let's check how fast your site loads. I'll open Google's free speed test tool." Then open:

Open the PageSpeed tool in their browser: `https://pagespeed.web.dev/`

Have the owner paste their site URL. Explain the scores: green (90+) is great, orange (50-89) needs work, red (<50) is urgent.

## Social preview
- [ ] `og:title`, `og:description`, and `og:image` present on every page in `dist/`
- [ ] `twitter:card` meta tag present (value: `summary_large_image` if og:image exists, `summary` otherwise)
- [ ] OG image file exists at the path referenced by `og:image` and is approximately 1200x630 pixels
- [ ] `apple-touch-icon.png` exists in `public/` (180x180) — if missing, run `npm run ai-images` to generate it
- [ ] `og-image.png` exists in `public/` — if missing, run `npm run ai-images` to generate it
- [ ] `manifest.webmanifest` icon paths reference files that actually exist in `public/`
- [ ] Test by pasting the site URL into a group chat or social media draft — the preview card should show the site title, description, and image
- [ ] Each page has its own `og:title` and `og:description` (not all the same)

## Reputation

If `BUSINESS_TYPE` is set in `.site-config`, invoke the reputation skill for review coaching and competitive awareness.

Read `REVIEW_PLATFORMS` from `.site-config` if available. When invoking the reputation skill, note that this is a non-interactive check context so it should present tips, not questions.

If `REVIEW_PLATFORMS` is set, include the platform names in the nudge: "Reminder: check your [Google, Yelp] reviews — responding within a few days helps your reputation." If not set, use the generic nudge.

Read the `reputation` skill and follow it. Include the output as a "Reputation" section in the health report. Keep it brief — 1-3 action items max. If `BUSINESS_TYPE` is not set, skip this section.

## Ecommerce scaling

If `ECOMMERCE_PROVIDER` is set in `.site-config`, assess whether the store has outgrown its current platform. This check uses `scripts/ecommerce-upgrade.ts`.

1. **Count products** — count `.mdoc` files in `src/content/products/` (if the directory exists)
2. **Check revenue** — if `ECOMMERCE_WEBHOOK_URL` is set in `.site-config`, query Analytics Engine using `buildRevenueQuery(30)` from `scripts/ecommerce-revenue.ts` to get 30-day revenue and order count
3. **Assess** — call `assessUpgrade()` with the provider, product count, and revenue data (if available)
4. **Report** — if an upgrade is recommended, include it in the health report using `formatUpgradeMessage()`. Frame it as "Worth looking into" (not "Must fix").

Example finding for the owner:

> "Your store has 14 products and is bringing in about $12,000/month — great work! At this size, you might benefit from switching to Shopify, which gives you a dashboard for inventory and orders. Snipcart charges about $240/month in fees at your volume; Shopify would be about $387/month but includes tools that save you time. No rush — just something to think about as you grow."

If no ecommerce provider is configured, skip this section entirely. Do not suggest adding ecommerce during a health check.

## Results

**The owner is not technical.** Do not report raw checklist items. Translate every finding into one plain-English sentence that answers: what's wrong, why it matters, and what happens next. Group by severity using these everyday labels:

- **Must fix before publishing** — "Your site has a problem that needs to be fixed before it can go live."
- **Worth fixing soon** — "This won't break anything, but fixing it will make your site better."
- **All good** — "This part of your site is working well."

Examples of how to translate findings:

| Technical finding | What to tell the owner |
|---|---|
| Missing alt text on 3 images | "Three photos on your site don't have descriptions for people who use screen readers. I can add those for you." |
| Low color contrast on body text | "The text on some pages is hard to read against the background. I'll adjust the colors so it's easier on the eyes." |
| OG tags missing | "When you share your site link in a text or on social media, it won't show a nice preview card yet. I can fix that." |
| h-card missing | "Search engines and other sites can't find your business name and address in a standard format. I'll add that to the page." |
| npm audit found vulnerability | "One of the behind-the-scenes tools has a known security issue. I'll update it." |
| CSP header misconfigured | "Your site's security settings need a small adjustment. I'll take care of it." |
| EXIF GPS data in images | "Some of your photos have location information embedded in them. I'll strip that out so visitors can't see where the photos were taken." |

Never show the owner: CSS selectors, HTML tag names, HTTP headers, schema.org terms, WCAG levels, npm package names, or code snippets. If you need to explain *why* something matters, use an analogy or a concrete consequence ("visitors on phones will have to scroll sideways").

**Summary:** After the audit, present a markdown scorecard so the owner sees at a glance what's working and what needs attention:

```
- [x] Build
- [x] Accessibility
- [ ] SEO  ← 2 issues
- [x] Security
- [x] Privacy
```

Use `[x]` for passing categories and `[ ]` for ones with issues. Add a brief annotation after any failing item.

If any must-fix issues are found, explain and offer to fix them. If everything passes, keep it short: "Your site looks good — it builds correctly, works on phones, is secure, and is easy for search engines to find. No issues."

After the check, tell the owner: "This is the same kind of checkup a good web developer would do regularly. Your site should get one of these at least once a month — just type `/anglesite:check` anytime."

## Stamp the maintenance log

After completing a full health audit (regardless of whether issues were found — running the check is the maintenance event), update `MAINTENANCE_MONTHLY_LAST` in `.site-config` to today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. Use the **Read** tool to load the file, then the **Write** tool to replace or append the line. This is what `/anglesite:deploy`'s pre-deploy scan reads when surfacing overdue-maintenance warnings (see `docs/webmaster.md` → Maintenance schedule).

Don't stamp the log if the audit was aborted early (e.g., the build failed before any checks ran) — only when the owner has actually been through the checkup.

## File bugs for persistent issues

After the audit, if any must-fix issues were found that couldn't be resolved in the current session, file a GitHub issue for each one. Read `GITHUB_REPO` from `.site-config`. If not set, skip this step.

Follow the bug filing workflow in `docs/bug-filing.md`. Use the appropriate label:
- Accessibility violations → `accessibility`
- Security findings → `security`
- Build failures → `build`
- Content issues → `content`
- Everything else → `bug`

If the issue is in Anglesite itself (not the owner's site), use the plugin bug filing workflow in `docs/bug-filing.md` to open a pre-filled issue in the owner's browser against `Anglesite/anglesite`.

## Troubleshooting

If the owner reported a specific problem (or you found one during the audit), diagnose and fix it.

### Step 0 — Look up current Cloudflare docs first

Cloudflare ships features quickly (Workers Static Assets, the Pages → Workers migration, bot management defaults, error code semantics). Before suggesting a fix for any Cloudflare-adjacent issue — DNS propagation, SPF/DKIM/DMARC, Workers limits, custom domain quirks, `wrangler` errors — call `mcp__cloudflare__search_cloudflare_documentation` with a query that names the symptom (e.g., "wrangler deploy 10021 error", "Workers static assets _headers precedence", "DMARC alignment p=quarantine"). Read the matching result before reasoning from training data. If the search returns nothing useful, say so to the owner rather than guessing.

This applies whenever the issue might involve Cloudflare behavior. Skip it for purely local issues (Node version, port conflicts, Astro build errors).

### Step 1 — Check prerequisites

```sh
npm run ai-check
```

Then read `.site-config` to verify it has `SITE_NAME` and `DEV_HOSTNAME`. If either is missing, suggest running `/anglesite:start` first.

### Common tool issues
- **Wrangler auth expired:** Run `npx wrangler login` to re-authenticate.
- **Dev server port conflict:** Run `lsof -i :4321` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :4321` (Windows) to find what's using port 4321.
- **fnm/Node not in PATH:** Run `npm run ai-setup` to fix shell profile.

### HTTPS / local preview issues
- **Certificate error in browser:** The local CA may not be trusted. Run `npm run ai-setup` to reinstall it.
- **"This site can't be reached":** Check hostname resolution:
  - macOS: `dscacheutil -q host -a name HOSTNAME`
  - Linux: `getent hosts HOSTNAME`
  - Windows: `nslookup HOSTNAME`
  Replace HOSTNAME with the value from `.site-config`. If it doesn't resolve to 127.0.0.1, run `npm run ai-setup`.
- **Port 443 not forwarding:** Run `npm run ai-check` and look for `https_portforward`. If missing, run `npm run ai-setup` (macOS auto-configures; Linux/Windows require manual setup — see setup log).
- **Certificate hostname mismatch:** Domain changed since cert was generated. Run `npm run ai-setup` to regenerate.
- **HTTPS works at :4321 but not :443:** Port forwarding rules not loaded. On macOS, run `npm run ai-setup` to reload pfctl. On Linux/Windows, check the setup log for manual instructions.

### Step 2 — Diagnose

1. Ask the owner to describe what's wrong (or what error they saw)
2. Check log files: `~/.anglesite/logs/build.log`, `deploy.log`, `check.log`, `dev.log`
3. Run `npx astro check` and `npm run build` to reproduce

### Step 3 — Fix it

1. Explain what went wrong in plain language
2. Fix it
3. Verify by running checks again
4. Ask if they want to publish the fix
