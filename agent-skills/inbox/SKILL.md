Persist submissions from `/anglesite:contact` and `/anglesite:forms` to Cloudflare D1, surface them in Keystatic as a `Form Submissions` collection, and triage from there. Closes the gap of digging through email for a single submission and gives spam triage a real home. Custom forms and the contact form share one inbox, distinguished by `formSlug`.

## Architecture decisions

- [ADR-0003 Cloudflare Workers](references/docs/decisions/0003-cloudflare-workers-hosting.md) — Workers + D1 are part of the Cloudflare stack already in use
- [ADR-0011 Owner ownership](references/docs/decisions/0011-owner-controls-everything.md) — the D1 database lives on the owner's account; the Workers are the only writers
- [ADR-0019 D1 inbox](references/docs/decisions/0019-d1-inbox.md) — why submissions live in D1 (filter, sort, status updates) instead of KV

Read `EXPLAIN_STEPS` from `.site-config`. If `true` or not set, explain before every tool call that triggers a permission prompt — say what you're about to do and why in plain language. If `false`, proceed without pre-announcing.

## Step 0 — Check prerequisites

Read `.site-config`:

- At least one of `CONTACT_WORKER_URL` or `FORMS_WORKER_URL` must be set
- `CF_PROJECT_NAME` and `SITE_DOMAIN` must be set (site has been deployed)

If neither worker URL exists, tell the owner: "Set up `/anglesite:contact` or `/anglesite:forms` first — the inbox sits on top of those workers."

If `INBOX_DB_ID` is already set in `.site-config`, the inbox is already configured — skip to Step 5 (sync) or Step 6 (triage and export).

## Step 1 — Create the D1 database

Tell the owner: "I'm creating a Cloudflare D1 database to store your form submissions. D1 is a SQL database at the edge — it's free up to 5 GB and 100,000 writes per day, more than a small business will ever need."

**Preferred — Cloudflare MCP (no copy-paste):**

1. Call `mcp__cloudflare__accounts_list` if the active account hasn't been resolved yet, then `mcp__cloudflare__set_active_account` with the matching `account_id`.
2. Call `mcp__cloudflare__d1_database_create` with `name: "form_submissions"`. Read the `uuid` (database ID) from the response.
3. Save the database ID to `.site-config` as `INBOX_DB_ID=<uuid>` using the Write tool.

**Fallback — wrangler CLI** (use only if the Cloudflare MCP server isn't connected):

```sh
npx wrangler d1 create form_submissions
```

Wrangler prints a block like:

```
✅ Successfully created DB 'form_submissions' in region <REGION>

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "INBOX_DB"
database_name = "form_submissions"
database_id = "abc123-def4-..."
```

Copy the `database_id` value. Save it to `.site-config` as `INBOX_DB_ID=abc123-def4-...` using the Write tool.

## Step 2 — Apply the schema

The schema (one `submissions` table plus two indexes) ships at `worker/schema.sql`. Apply it once to the live database:

```sh
npx wrangler d1 execute form_submissions --remote --file=worker/schema.sql
```

If `worker/schema.sql` is missing on an older site, run `/anglesite:update` first to copy it in, then re-run the execute command. The schema uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` so re-running it is safe.

## Step 3 — Wire the binding into each worker

For every deployed worker (`worker/wrangler.toml` for the contact form, `worker/forms-wrangler.toml` for the forms handler), uncomment the `[[d1_databases]]` block and replace `REPLACE_WITH_D1_DATABASE_ID` with the saved `INBOX_DB_ID`. The binding name must remain `INBOX_DB`. Use the Edit tool — do not Write the whole file.

Example (after edit):

```toml
[[d1_databases]]
binding = "INBOX_DB"
database_name = "form_submissions"
database_id = "abc123-def4-..."
```

## Step 4 — Set INBOX_SECRET on every worker and locally

Generate a long random secret (use the owner's `openssl rand -hex 32` or any password manager). Tell the owner: "I'll save this token in two places — in Cloudflare so the workers can verify it, and locally in `.env.local` so the sync script can use it."

For each worker that exists (`contact-form` and/or `forms-handler`):

```sh
npx wrangler secret put INBOX_SECRET --name contact-form
```

```sh
npx wrangler secret put INBOX_SECRET --name forms-handler
```

Tell the owner to paste the same value when prompted.

Then write the secret to `.env.local` (gitignored) using the Write tool:

```
INBOX_SECRET=<paste-the-same-value>
```

If `.env.local` already exists, append the line.

## Step 5 — Redeploy the workers

Each worker now needs to re-deploy so the D1 binding and the secret are picked up. Run only the deploy commands that match what's installed on this site:

```sh
npx wrangler deploy --config worker/wrangler.toml
```

```sh
npx wrangler deploy --config worker/forms-wrangler.toml
```

## Step 6 — Sync the inbox

Pull new submissions from D1 into `src/content/submissions/`:

```sh
npm run ai-inbox-fetch
```

Tell the owner what you saw — e.g. "Synced 4 new submissions, skipped 12 already on disk." Existing local files are never overwritten so the owner's triage edits (`status`, `notes`) are safe.

Open Keystatic and route them to the **Form Submissions** collection so they can review and triage. The list shows newest first; each entry includes:

- The form it came from (`formSlug`)
- Sender name and email (best-effort, derived from the submitted fields)
- Status — `New`, `Archived`, or `Spam`
- Every submitted value
- A private notes field for owner-only commentary

Triage actions are just edits to the `status` field — no special tooling. Encourage the owner to bulk-process: archive what's resolved, mark spam as spam.

## Step 6b — AI triage (when available)

On an Apple-Silicon Mac with Apple Intelligence enabled, `npm run ai-inbox-fetch`
also classifies each **new** submission **on-device** — nothing is uploaded.
Each new submission gets three advisory fields: `aiCategory`
(lead / support / question / other), `aiSpam` (yes / no), and `aiReason` (the
model's short rationale).

These are **suggestions only**. The owner's `status` field is never changed
automatically — a misclassified message is never hidden. Surface the suggestion
and let the owner decide.

After a sync, the script prints a one-line summary like
`Triaged 3 new: 1 likely spam, 2 leads`. **Relay this to the owner in chat** so
they get the overview before opening Keystatic — e.g. "3 new submissions: 1
looks like spam, 2 look like leads. Open the inbox to confirm and triage."

### When `fm` is not available

On any other machine, no AI fields are written and nothing breaks — the owner
triages `status` manually exactly as before. To disable AI triage even on a
capable Mac, set `INBOX_TRIAGE_AI=off` in `.site-config`.

## Step 7 — Export to CSV (optional)

Lead-capture and survey responses are easier to work with in a spreadsheet. The export script reads the same files Keystatic shows:

```sh
npm run ai-inbox-export -- --slug=lead --status=new --out=leads.csv
```

Available filters:

- `--slug=<formSlug>` — only this form (e.g. `contact`, `lead`, `rsvp`)
- `--status=new|archived|spam` — only this status
- `--since=YYYY-MM-DD` — only submissions on or after this date
- `--out=<path>` — write to a file instead of stdout

Without `--out`, CSV is printed to stdout so the owner can pipe it into a spreadsheet, an email, or another tool.

## Notes

- **Per-form thread.** The `formSlug` field separates contact-form messages from each custom form. The Keystatic list view groups by form when the owner wants — sort or filter on `formSlug`. The `/inbox` Worker endpoint also accepts `?slug=<slug>` and `?status=<status>` query parameters that translate directly into indexed `WHERE` clauses on the D1 table.
- **Email still works.** D1 persistence is best-effort; even if the D1 write fails the worker still emails the owner. The inbox is a complement, not a replacement.
- **Privacy.** Submission data lives in `src/content/submissions/` and is committed to the owner's private Git repo as part of the standard backup flow. It is *not* rendered on the public site (no Astro page reads from this collection). Keep the repo private.
- **PII scan.** Submissions contain emails and phone numbers, but the pre-deploy PII scan only walks `dist/` (built HTML) — the submissions never get rendered onto a public page so the scan is unaffected. Confirm by running `npm run predeploy` after a sync.
- **Schema upgrades.** Re-running `npx wrangler d1 execute form_submissions --remote --file=worker/schema.sql` is idempotent. New indexes added to `worker/schema.sql` in a future template release will apply cleanly during `/anglesite:update`.
