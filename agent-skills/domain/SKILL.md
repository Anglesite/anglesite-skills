Manage DNS records for the owner's domain on Cloudflare. All DNS changes are made directly via the Cloudflare API — never ask the owner to add, remove, or modify DNS records themselves. Never open the Cloudflare dashboard for DNS operations.

## Architecture decisions

- [ADR-0003 Cloudflare Workers](references/docs/decisions/0003-cloudflare-workers-hosting.md) — why DNS is managed through Cloudflare (API access, at-cost registration)
- [ADR-0011 Owner ownership](references/docs/decisions/0011-owner-controls-everything.md) — why the domain is in the owner's account

Read `EXPLAIN_STEPS` from `.site-config`. If `true` or not set, tell the owner what you're about to do and why in plain English before making any change, and confirm what was done after. If `false`, proceed without pre-announcing changes (still confirm after).

## Look up current Cloudflare docs first

Before explaining DNS records, verification flows, propagation behavior, or any Cloudflare-specific quirk to the owner, call `mcp__cloudflare__search_cloudflare_documentation` with a query that names what's being set up (e.g., "DMARC record syntax Cloudflare DNS", "Bluesky _atproto TXT verification", "domain verification CAA record", "MX records Cloudflare Email Routing"). Read the matching result before answering — Cloudflare ships changes to defaults and dashboard flows often, and stale advice misroutes the owner. If the search returns nothing useful, say so rather than guessing from training data.

Skip this when the request is mechanical (e.g., the owner pasted the exact records a third party told them to add).

## Prerequisites

Read `SITE_DOMAIN` from `.site-config`. If not set, tell the owner: "You need a custom domain first. Run `/anglesite:deploy` to set one up."

Read `CF_PROJECT_NAME` from `.site-config` to identify the Cloudflare project.

## Cloudflare API access

All DNS operations use the Cloudflare API with a scoped API token.

Read `CF_API_TOKEN` from `.env`. If not set, the owner needs to create one (one-time setup):

Tell the owner: "To manage your domain's DNS records, I need a Cloudflare API token. I'll walk you through creating one — it takes about 30 seconds."

Open the API tokens page in their browser: `https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens`

Walk them through:
1. Click **Create Token**
2. Find the **Edit zone DNS** template and click **Use template**
3. Under Zone Resources, select **Specific zone** → their domain
4. Click **Continue to summary** → **Create Token**
5. Copy the token value shown

Save the token to `.env` using the **Write tool** (update or create the file, adding `CF_API_TOKEN=the-token-value`). **Never save API tokens to `.site-config`** — that file is committed to git. `.env` is gitignored and stays local.

Then get the zone ID:

```sh
CF_API_TOKEN=$(grep CF_API_TOKEN .env | cut -d= -f2)
CF_ZONE_ID=$(curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones?name=SITE_DOMAIN" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN" | jq -r '.result[0].id')
```

Replace `SITE_DOMAIN` with the root domain (no `www.`). If the zone ID comes back null, the token may be invalid or the domain not yet active on Cloudflare.

## Proactive: Bluesky handle verification

Before asking what the owner needs, check `.site-config` for `BLUESKY_HANDLE`. If the owner is on Bluesky but still using a `.bsky.social` handle, proactively offer: "I noticed you're on Bluesky — want me to set up your domain as your Bluesky handle? People would see @SITE_DOMAIN instead of your current handle. It takes about a minute."

If `BLUESKY_HANDLE` is not set, and this is the first time running `/anglesite:domain`, ask: "By the way — are you on Bluesky? It's a social network where your domain becomes your handle, so people see @yourdomain.com. If you have an account, I can set that up in about a minute."

Read `references/docs/domain-guide.md` for context on why domain-as-identity matters across the open web.

## Domain education

If this is the first time running `/anglesite:domain`, surface the domain education prompts from `references/docs/education-prompts.md` section 2 ("Domain Setup"). Check `.site-config` for each `EDUCATION_<KEY>=shown` flag before surfacing. Share `DOMAIN_VS_WEBSITE`, `DOMAIN_RENEWAL`, `EMAIL_NOT_AUTOMATIC`, and `TLD_AND_SEO` as a brief aside — the owner may have already heard these during `/anglesite:deploy`, so the flags prevent repetition. Write any new flags to `.site-config` after.

## What do you need?

Ask: "What do you need to set up on your domain?" Common requests:

### Email

For email setup (business mailboxes at the owner's domain), invoke the email skill:

Read and follow the `email` skill

The email skill expects the Cloudflare API context (`CF_API_TOKEN`, `CF_ZONE_ID`) to already be available. Ensure the Cloudflare API access section above has been completed before invoking it.

### Bluesky verification

To verify a custom domain as their Bluesky handle:

1. Ask the owner for their current Bluesky handle (e.g., `@user.bsky.social`)
2. Tell them: go to Bluesky Settings → Account → Handle → "I have my own domain" and read back the value shown (looks like `did=did:plc:abc123...`)
3. Tell the owner: "I'm adding a verification record to your domain so Bluesky knows it's yours."
4. Add the TXT record:
   ```sh
   curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/dns_records" \
     -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"type":"TXT","name":"_atproto","content":"did=did:plc:VALUE","ttl":1,"proxied":false}'
   ```
5. Confirm: "Done — I added the verification record. Go back to Bluesky and click 'Verify DNS Record'. Once verified, your Bluesky handle will be your domain name — people will see @yourdomain.com instead of @user.bsky.social."
6. After verification succeeds, save `BLUESKY_HANDLE=@SITE_DOMAIN` to `.site-config` using the **Write tool**.

### Google site verification

For Google Search Console, Google Business Profile, or other Google services:

1. Google will provide either a TXT record or a CNAME record
2. Tell the owner: "I'm adding Google's verification record to your domain."
3. Add the record via the API (same pattern as above)
4. Confirm what was added, then tell the owner to return to Google and click verify

### Other DNS records

For any other service that needs DNS records:

1. Ask the owner what service they're connecting
2. Ask for the DNS records the service requires (they'll be in the service's setup instructions)
3. Tell the owner what you're adding and why
4. Add each record via the API
5. Confirm what was done

### View current records

If the owner wants to see what's currently set up:

```sh
curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/dns_records?per_page=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN" | jq -r '.result[] | "\(.type)\t\(.name)\t\(.content)\t(proxied: \(.proxied))"'
```

Translate the output into plain English. Example: "Your domain has 5 DNS records: your website address (www), two email routing records, a spam prevention record, and your Bluesky verification."

### Remove a record

If a record needs to be removed (e.g., switching email providers):

1. List current records to find the record ID
2. Tell the owner what you're removing and why
3. Delete it:
   ```sh
   curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$CF_ZONE_ID/dns_records/RECORD_ID" \
     -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_API_TOKEN"
   ```
4. Confirm: "I removed [description]. Here's why: [reason]."

When switching email providers, always remove old MX records before adding new ones to avoid conflicts.

## After any change

Update `docs/cloudflare.md` with what was added or removed and why. Example:

```
### DNS records
- MX: iCloud Mail servers (email delivery)
- TXT (SPF): v=spf1 include:icloud.com ~all (spam prevention)
- TXT (_atproto): Bluesky domain verification
```

## Safety rules

- **Never change the CNAME record for `www`** — that points to the Workers project
- **Never change nameservers** via the API
- **When switching email providers**, remove old MX records before adding new ones
- **Email records must be DNS only** (`"proxied": false`) — MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC should never be proxied
- **Before deleting any record**, tell the owner what you're removing and why
