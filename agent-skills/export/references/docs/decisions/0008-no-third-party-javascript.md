# No third-party JavaScript in production

> **This is a default decision.** If you need a specific third-party script (e.g., a booking widget, live chat, or different analytics), tell your Webmaster — they'll add it to the CSP allowlist, update the pre-deploy scan, and record the change here.

## Context and Problem Statement

Third-party JavaScript (analytics, social embeds, chat widgets, ad networks) is the primary vector for visitor tracking, data collection, and security vulnerabilities on the modern web. The Webmaster agent must decide a default policy for external scripts on sites it builds for owners who may not understand the privacy and security implications.

## Decision Drivers

* Visitor privacy — no tracking, fingerprinting, or data collection without informed consent
* Security — every external script is an attack surface (supply chain attacks, XSS)
* Performance — external scripts add latency, block rendering, and increase page weight
* Legal compliance — GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations require disclosure of third-party data processors
* Owner simplicity — fewer moving parts means less to maintain and less to explain
* Content Security Policy — strict CSP headers are only practical with controlled script sources

## Considered Options

* No third-party JavaScript (with seven exceptions)
* Selective third-party scripts with owner approval
* Standard analytics and social stacks (Google Analytics, social embeds, chat widgets)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "No third-party JavaScript", with eight exceptions:

1. **Cloudflare Web Analytics** — `static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js`, injected by the Anglesite layouts (`BaseLayout.astro`, `KioskLayout.astro`, `ImmersiveLayout.astro`) when `CF_WEB_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` is set in `.site-config`. Uses no cookies, collects no personal data. Wired up by `/anglesite:deploy` on the first deploy so launch traffic is captured.
2. **Cloudflare Turnstile** — privacy-respecting CAPTCHA alternative used by the contact form (`/anglesite:contact`). Same vendor as the hosting platform, no cookies, no tracking. Only loaded on the `/contact` page.
3. **Polar checkout overlay** (`cdn.polar.sh`) — open-source, indie-web-aligned checkout overlay for digital product sales. Acts as Merchant of Record (handles global VAT/sales tax). Only loaded on pages with a `PolarCheckout` component. No cookies or visitor tracking beyond the checkout transaction.
4. **Snipcart** (`cdn.snipcart.com`) — shopping cart for small physical product catalogs. No monthly fee (2% per transaction + Stripe fees). Only loaded on pages with product components and the Snipcart container. No visitor tracking beyond the checkout transaction.
5. **Shopify Buy Button** (`cdn.shopify.com`, `sdks.shopifycdn.com`) — embeddable product cards and checkout for full product catalogs managed in Shopify's admin dashboard. Starting at $5/month. Only loaded on pages with a `ShopifyBuyButton` component.
6. **Paddle** (`cdn.paddle.com`, `sandbox-cdn.paddle.com`) — checkout overlay for software licensing, SaaS subscriptions, and metered billing. Acts as Merchant of Record (handles global tax compliance). Only loaded on pages with a `PaddleCheckout` component. No visitor tracking beyond the checkout transaction.
7. **Lemon Squeezy** (`assets.lemonsqueezy.com`) — checkout overlay for digital product sales (downloads, courses, memberships). Acts as Merchant of Record (handles global VAT/sales tax). Alternative to Polar — owner preference determines which is used. Only loaded on pages with a `LemonSqueezyCheckout` component. No visitor tracking beyond the checkout transaction.
8. **Giscus** (`giscus.app`) — open-source comments widget that stores threads as GitHub Discussions on a public repo the owner controls. Loader script and iframe both load from `giscus.app`. Only loaded on blog post pages, and only when `COMMENTS_PROVIDER=giscus` is set in `.site-config`. No cookies on the parent site; GitHub identity flow happens inside the iframe. Per-post opt-out via `comments: false` in post frontmatter.

All other external scripts are blocked by default, enforced by the Content Security Policy and pre-deploy scans.

### Creative coding libraries (not third-party)

npm-installed creative coding libraries (p5.js, Three.js, GSAP, Tone.js, D3.js, and others) are **not** third-party scripts. They are bundled by Astro's build process and served as first-party JavaScript from the same origin. The CSP `script-src 'self'` policy covers them without modification. These libraries are used by the `creative-canvas` skill to add interactive visual effects to any site — from a web artist's generative art portfolio to a bakery's holiday snow effect. No CSP allowlist entry or pre-deploy scan exception is needed.

The same reasoning covers npm-installed **animation component libraries**. The
Anglesite site template ships `@astroanimate/core` (exact-pinned) as a default
dependency: its components are CSS-first, rendered at build time, and served
first-party under `script-src 'self'`. One constraint applies: the library's
`enhance` prop emits inline `<script>` tags, which the template CSP blocks
(no `'unsafe-inline'`, no hashes) — so only CSS-only usage (`enhance` unset or
`false`) is supported. The curated list lives in the site's
`integrations/docs/animations.md`.

### Consequences

* Good, because visitors are not tracked, fingerprinted, or profiled
* Good, because no third-party data processors to disclose in a privacy policy
* Good, because the Content Security Policy can be strict — `script-src 'self' static.cloudflareinsights.com`
* Good, because no supply-chain risk from compromised external scripts
* Good, because pages load faster without external script requests
* Good, because the owner never receives a GDPR complaint about undisclosed tracking
* Bad, because the owner cannot add Google Analytics, social media embeds, or live chat without explicitly requesting a policy exception
* Bad, because some owners may expect these features and perceive their absence as a limitation

### Confirmation

The pre-deploy scan and Content Security Policy are now config-driven (see `template/scripts/csp.ts`). Only providers listed in `.site-config` (`ECOMMERCE_PROVIDER`, `BOOKING_PROVIDER`, `COMMENTS_PROVIDER`, `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY`) are permitted — all others are blocked. The `/anglesite:check` skill verifies the CSP matches the configured providers.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### No third-party JavaScript (with Cloudflare Analytics exception)

* Good, because zero visitor tracking beyond privacy-respecting, cookieless analytics
* Good, because strict CSP is enforceable and effective
* Good, because no third-party data processors — simpler legal compliance
* Good, because eliminates entire categories of security risk
* Good, because fastest possible page loads
* Neutral, because Cloudflare Web Analytics is the one allowed beacon — injected by the Anglesite layouts when `CF_WEB_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` is set in `.site-config`
* Bad, because owners who want Google Analytics or social embeds must request an exception

### Selective third-party scripts with owner approval

* Good, because owner has flexibility to add services they want
* Good, because approval process ensures informed consent
* Bad, because each approved script weakens the CSP
* Bad, because the owner may not understand the privacy implications of what they're approving
* Bad, because ongoing maintenance burden — scripts update, break, or change data practices

### Standard analytics and social stacks

* Good, because matches what most conventional websites include
* Good, because familiar tools (Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, etc.)
* Bad, because tracks visitors by default — requires cookie consent banners
* Bad, because adds third-party data processors requiring privacy policy disclosure
* Bad, because increases page weight and load time significantly
* Bad, because creates supply-chain security risk
* Bad, because contradicts the privacy-first values of the platform

## More Information

Preferred privacy-respecting alternatives to common third-party scripts:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| Google Analytics | Cloudflare Web Analytics (auto-included) |
| Google Maps embed | OpenStreetMap static image or link |
| Social media embeds | Snapshotted first-party embed cards (see ADR-0025) |
| Google Fonts CDN | System fonts or self-hosted WOFF2 (see ADR-0005) |
| Live chat widget | Contact form with Cloudflare Worker backend |
| YouTube embed | Snapshotted card linking to the video, with a self-hosted thumbnail (see ADR-0025) |
| Disqus or Facebook comments | Giscus (GitHub Discussions) — see exception #8 |

Each alternative eliminates a third-party dependency while preserving the functionality the owner needs.

Note that the social-embed and YouTube rows do **not** add an exception to the list above.
A snapshotted embed card is first-party HTML and first-party images served from the owner's
own domain, so it needs no CSP allowlist entry at all — which is the test of whether an
"alternative" genuinely preserves this ADR rather than quietly widening it. See ADR-0025.
