# First-Time Setup

**Prerequisite:** [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) (recommended) or [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

The user opens the project folder in their AI coding tool and runs the `anglesite:start` command.

## Two phases

### Phase 1: `anglesite:start` — Business discovery + design + tools (~30 minutes)

Meet the owner. Learn the business name and type. Run a design interview (guided by `docs/design-system.md`) to choose colors, typography, and page structure. Install tools (fnm, Node, mkcert, HTTPS certs, hostname resolution, port forwarding) and dependencies. Preview the branded site at `https://DEV_HOSTNAME`.

### Phase 2: `anglesite:deploy` — Go live (~15 minutes)

Cloudflare account creation, build, security scan, deploy. Domain purchase, transfer, or DNS configuration.

## Detection

The webmaster can detect state by checking:

- No `.site-config` or no `SITE_NAME` in it → need `anglesite:start`
- No `docs/brand.md` → need `anglesite:start` (or `anglesite:design-interview` if `.site-config` exists)
- No `CF_PROJECT_NAME` in `.site-config` → offer `anglesite:deploy`
