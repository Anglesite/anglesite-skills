# Content Import Workflow

Import blog posts, pages, and images from an existing website URL.

To convert an existing static site generator project (Hugo, Jekyll, Eleventy,
etc.) in the current directory, see [convert.md](convert.md) instead.

## Supported platforms

WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, Webflow, GoDaddy, Ghost, Medium, Substack, Blogger, Shopify, Weebly, Tumblr, Micro.blog, WriteFreely, Carrd

## Import principles

1. **Content accuracy over visual fidelity** — get all content moved correctly first, design tweaks after
2. **Download all images locally** — no external image dependencies
3. **Generate descriptions** from first 1-2 sentences if no excerpt field exists
4. **Generate titles** for untitled posts (microblog-style) — first sentence, truncated at 60 characters
5. **Preserve provenance** — every imported post gets a `syndication` URL pointing to the original
6. **Strip third-party embeds** — YouTube, Twitter, Instagram embeds become comments noting what was there
7. **Don't replicate platform features** — booking, stores, events can't be imported; redirect and recommend replacements
8. **Build must pass** — fix every build error before presenting results
9. **Warn about CDN expiry** — for platforms where image URLs expire, warn before cancelling the old account

## Getting started

The import workflow does not require setup to have been run first. It adapts to the working directory:

- **Existing Anglesite project** — imports directly into the existing site
- **Empty directory** — asks for a website URL, scaffolds a new Anglesite project, then imports

If the directory contains an SSG project, the workflow directs you to use the [convert workflow](convert.md) instead.

## How it works

1. Detect the platform from the website URL
2. Read the shared guidance doc: `docs/import/hosted-platforms.md`
3. Read the platform-specific doc: `docs/import/PLATFORM.md`
4. Extract content (RSS feed, API, or HTML scraping)
5. Convert to Markdoc (`.mdoc`) files in `src/content/posts/`
6. Download images to `public/images/blog/`
7. Generate redirect mappings from old URLs
8. Run `npm run build` to verify
9. Present results

## Content format

Imported posts land as `.mdoc` files in `src/content/posts/` with frontmatter:

```yaml
title: "Post Title"
description: "First 1-2 sentences"
publishDate: "2024-01-15"
syndication:
  - https://old-platform.com/original-post-url
```

## After import

- Review all imported content for accuracy
- Check that all images downloaded successfully
- Verify the build passes: `npm run build`
- Deploy when ready: `/anglesite:deploy` (or merge `draft` → `main` and push)
