# Anglesite

An AI webmaster for independent websites — a [Claude plugin](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) that scaffolds, designs, and deploys Astro sites on Cloudflare Workers.

Anglesite works with [Claude Cowork](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13345190-get-started-with-cowork) (for non-technical site owners) and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (for developers). Both use the same plugin — the experience adapts to the environment.

## Install

### Claude Cowork (recommended for site owners)

Plugins in Cowork require a paid plan (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise).

1. Open [Claude](https://claude.ai) and start a Cowork session
2. Open the **Code** tab
3. Press **+** > **Plugins** > **Add Plugin**
4. Select the **Personal** tab, press **+**
5. Select **Add Marketplace from GitHub**
6. Enter `Anglesite/anglesite-skills` and press **Sync**
7. Enable the **anglesite** plugin
8. Create a new folder for your site and open it in the **Code** tab
9. Type `/anglesite:start`

No terminal, no installs, no prerequisites. Claude handles everything.

### Claude Code (for developers)

```sh
# Add the marketplace (one-time)
claude plugin marketplace add Anglesite/anglesite-skills

# Install the plugin
claude plugin install anglesite

# Start a new project
mkdir my-site && cd my-site
claude
```

Then type `/anglesite:start` to begin.

### Open Agent Skills (any AI coding agent)

Individual skills can be installed in any agent that supports the [Open Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) spec ([skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh)):

```sh
# Browse and install from the full collection
npx skills add Anglesite/anglesite-skills/agent-skills

# Install a single skill
npx skills add Anglesite/anglesite-skills/agent-skills/start

# Examples
npx skills add Anglesite/anglesite-skills/agent-skills/deploy
npx skills add Anglesite/anglesite-skills/agent-skills/seo
npx skills add Anglesite/anglesite-skills/agent-skills/contact
```

Always include the `agent-skills/` path. `skills/` holds the Claude Code plugin sources, which only run inside the plugin. Each skill is self-contained with bundled reference material. See [`agent-skills/README.md`](agent-skills/README.md) for the full list of available skills.

The start command scaffolds your project, learns about your business, designs the site with you, and installs the tools to preview it. When you're ready to go live, `/anglesite:deploy` handles hosting, domains, and publishing.

## Who this is for

Small businesses — farms, restaurants, legal firms, retailers, makers, artists, content creators, service providers — who want a fast, private, professional website without learning to code.

## Philosophy

- **The website is the center** — Publish here first, syndicate elsewhere (POSSE)
- **IndieWeb first** — Microformats, Webmention, IndieAuth. The owner controls their identity and content.
- **Accessible by design** — WCAG AA minimum. Not an afterthought.
- **No external runtime dependencies** — Zero third-party JavaScript in production
- **Privacy by default** — No tracking, no cookies, no third-party scripts (Cloudflare Web Analytics only)
