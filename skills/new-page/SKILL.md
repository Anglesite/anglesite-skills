Create a new page on the site.

## Planning

Before creating the page, show the owner where it fits in the site structure. Glob `src/pages/` for existing pages and present a nested markdown list with the proposed new page highlighted, e.g.:

```
- /
  - /about
  - /services
  - /contact
  - /events  ← new page
```

This helps the owner understand navigation impact and approve the placement.

## Architecture decisions

- [ADR-0001 Astro](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/decisions/0001-astro-static-site-generator.md) — pages are `.astro` files with zero client JS by default
- [ADR-0004 Vanilla CSS](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/decisions/0004-vanilla-css-custom-properties.md) — styling uses CSS custom properties from `global.css`
- [ADR-0005 System fonts](${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/decisions/0005-system-fonts.md) — no external font loading

1. Ask what the page is for and what content it should have

   **Experiment pages:** If the owner wants an interactive experiment, creative coding piece, or visual effect page, delegate to the `creative-canvas` skill (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/creative-canvas/SKILL.md`). It handles library installation, layout selection (`ImmersiveLayout` for full-viewport experiments), canvas setup, and accessibility requirements. This applies to any business type — not just web artists.

2. Create the `.astro` file in `src/pages/`
3. Use `BaseLayout` with proper title, description, and OG tags (or `ImmersiveLayout` for experiment pages)
4. Follow the standards checklist:
   - Semantic HTML (headings, sections, nav)
   - Responsive (works on phone, tablet, desktop)
   - Accessible — validate with `scripts/a11y-validate.ts`: single h1, no skipped heading levels, descriptive link text, meaningful alt text on all images, color contrast meeting WCAG AA (verify with `scripts/contrast.ts`)
   - Performance (optimized images, no unnecessary JS)
   - SEO (title, meta description, OG tags)
   - Matches the brand from `docs/brand.md` and follows `docs/design-system.md` and `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/docs/style-guide.md`
   - CSS passes `npm run lint:css` (design token enforcement via Stylelint)
5. Add navigation link if appropriate
6. Preview on the dev server
7. Ask if they want to publish

## Important: Keep docs in sync

Update `docs/architecture.md` with the new page and its purpose.
